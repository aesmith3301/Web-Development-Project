The requirement of this project -> please see requirement.txt

Hey girl, please see home.html and if there is anything that needs to be changed feel free to let me know. 

1.some changes to our project:
The home page does not look as we expected in the proposal > < Hopefully it does not look too bad.
My idea so far is to make this website more like a psychological forum. Since Dr.Mitra requires us to use cookie, which basically means we have to set up a login/ registration for users (otherwise I cannot come up with any other way to use cookie
> <,) maybe we can let each user register an account (then we can use MySQL to save their password) and ask them to select different psychology tests, each test only contains very few questions, and we can use PHP to process their answer and give them the assessment. Plus, maybe build each user a profile to wrap up all the assessments from different tests to one page (sounds like a lot of work so we can do that only if time permits). Or we can make a comment page that literally just allows users to post their thoughts about the page. We can further discuss other ideas.



2.The quizzes we are going to use:
I did not find a quiz that can take users to redirect to different questions based on their previous answers, nor the one that gives an overall assessment. > < The ones I found by far are 

castle theme:
https://www.learning-mind.com/the-castle-an-impressive-test-that-will-say-much-about-your-personality/
forest theme:
https://www.higherperspectives.com/walk-in-the-woods-test-1406161837.html
Oasis theme:
https://www.higherperspectives.com/the-oasis-test-relational-psychology-quiz-1406163822.html?c=article

These above are doable > < but it would be great if you happen to find a better one.
We can choose two of them (the castle one is pretty good), and each of us works on one of the two.




3.Pages we need:  ----we can divide our work

1)homepage
2)registration/login  page + MySQL
3)theme1 page   PHP + Cookie + session ….
4)theme2 page   PHP + Cookie + session ….
5)user comments page
